## Elma status 18.01.19 (no code changes)

### Problems with lookup of organization number 16-17 January

We experienced errors with lookup of organization numbers, which blocked adding new participants.

The problem lasted from 00:05 - 11:10 (CET) 16.01.2019 and 18:05 - 07:45 17.01.2019.

### Registration dates and organization names

Wrong registration dates in ELMA have now been fixed (15.01.2019). Those who erroneously had 13.11.2018 as a registration date, should now be correct.

Empty organizational names have been fixed (11.01.2019) in the database.

### Hotell.difi.no now updates every hour

Updates are now back to being done every hour. If you wish to download updated datasets as soon as they are available, please do so by checking the ETag HTTP header before downloading the entire dataset.

### Known error - deleted participants in hotell.difi.no

We have a known error where deleted organizations (i.e. organizations with no participants in ELMA) are still present in the datasets. In the dataset, they are specified to have no processes and no capabilities, so this should not interfere with normal business logic.

We plan to fix this in a later release of ELMA.


## Elma update 10.01.19 (version 3.0.4)

### Changes
```
[MOVE-888]  - Remove temporary set-user-password method
[MOVE-1143] - Change how login events are persisted
[MOVE-1207] - Domain identifiers do not support underscore
[MOVE-1046] - WS - add/deleteParticipant: Inconsistent error messages for invalid organization numbers
[MOVE-1132] - Wrong values in participant- and capabilities report
[MOVE-1145] - Encoding issue in registration e-mails
[MOVE-1159] - WS - editParticipant updates regardless of error response
[MOVE-1170] - WS - Businesscard service should expose cards for all recipients in ELMA, regardless of ICD
[MOVE-1202] - Issue with integration tests due to spring-boot-maven-plugin
[MOVE-1204] - Remove encoded carriage return from the endpoint certificate of the SMP response
```

### Known issues

Wrong registration dates. Due to an error in the migration from ELMA2 to ELMA3, all organizations registered in ELMA before 13.11.2018, have registration date set to 13.11.2018.

Organizations with old or blank organization name. Some organizations have either a blank organization name or an outdated name.

Both these issues are corrected in the export to hotell.difi.no, but are visible in elma-web. Both issues are being worked on.


## Elma update 11.12.18 (version 3.0.3)

### Changes
```
MOVE-1151	- Automatically choose endpoint while registering participants using the WS
MOVE-1149	- Automatically assign processes to logically equivalent participants
MOVE-1148	- Automatically create logically equivalent participants
MOVE-1147	- Registering processes on a valid participants
MOVE-1146	- Registering processes with varied participant requirements
MOVE-1144	- Added frontpage on the provider: http://smp.difi.no
MOVE-1134	- Fixed namespace bug in the Business card service.
MOVE-1101	- Added contact information about other service providers and endpoints
MOVE-1081	- Fixed bug: Organization name was not automatically found from the Brreg.no registry while adding or editing a participant using the WS.
MOVE-1075	- Alphabetical sorting on the "processes" list
MOVE-1064	- Reject attemps of registering a process which has a dependency registered on another endpoint
MOVE-1025	- Additional search functions for pages with long lists
MOVE-647 - Organizational names are now updated periodically from brreg.no
MOVE-1052 - Participants registration date is now visible. (see issue below)
```

### Bug - Registration date field

The participants registration date field is back in Elma, but there is an issue that causes registration dates from *before* 13.11.18 to be shown as registered 13.11.18. Any participant registered after this date has the correct date. We are going to fix this soon, but we didn't have the time to get the fix into this build version.

### Important issue - please read

We have discovered a severe error which unfortunately leads to some complications while registering participants in Elma. This means that if you’re going to register the new ICD 0192 on an already existing participant (ICD 9908) you will need to do it in a certain order for it to work correctly. 

Please follow this order:
1.	Delete the existing 9908 participant.
2.	Create the new 0192 participant with your chosen processes.

This will automatically recreate the 9908 participant. This means you will see both participants in the view, please do not delete this new 9908 participant or any of its processes. 

This is a necessary temporary solution.
